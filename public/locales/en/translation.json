The goal of these game is to remember what symbol appeared either two cards ago  and determine if they match with the currently shown card. The cards shift left and flip over after each guess. The card on the right is face up displaying a symbol, while the two cards, three for Overdrive, on the left are face down, forcing you to remember what they displayed previously.\n\nMemory Match starts with all 3 cards facing up, allowing you to quickly memorize the left and middle cards. After a few seconds, the left and middle cards flip to face down. You then must determine if the symbol on the face up card on the right matches the symbol on the face down card on the left. Press the left arrow key to choose “No” or press the right arrow key to choose “Yes.”\n\nAfter selecting you answer, the cards shift left and a new card is pulled from the pile on the right. The card that was previously face up on the right is now face down in the middle. And the card previously in the middle is now on the left. You need to determine if the newly pulled card matches the card now on the left.\n\nAnswering incorrectly causes all the cards to be revealed. The left and middle cards flip back to face down once you answer correctly again.",
